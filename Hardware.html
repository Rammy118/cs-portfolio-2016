    <h1> Hardware</h1>
    <h2> Motherboard</h2>
    <img src="motherboard.jpg" alt="Motherboard" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p id="Hardware"> A motherboard is a board that is found inside computers and has the memory and CPU of the computer. It is the most important component of the computer and without it the computer will not work. It lets the drive and other parts of the computer communicate with each other. It is also the source for the computerâ€™s power by connecting the other parts to it.  </p>

    <h2> CPU</h2>
    <img src="cpu.jpg" alt="CPU" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p id="Hardware"> A central processing unit is a circuit that tells the computer what to do. Whenever there is a release of a new processor, CPU becomes better. All other parts of the computer have to pass data to the CPU before they can start working. </p>

    <h2> RAM</h2>
    <img src="ram.jpg" alt="RAM" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p id="Hardware"> RAM stands for random access memory reads data and it can randomly be accessed with no need of getting to bytes. It is the most abundant memory type in technology. It has DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) and SRAM (Static Random Access Memory). DRAM is used more and SRAM is faster than DRAM because you do not need to refresh it. It can be used to directly access memory of a certain piece of technology if the row and column that intersect at a certain memory cell are known. </p>

    <h2> Hard Drive</h2>
    <img src="hard drive.jpg" alt="Hard Drive" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p id="Hardware"> Hard disk drive stores and obtains data using rotating disks with magnetic objects. The arm of a hard drive interprets data onto the disc. It goes from the center to the edge writing data. The tracks on the hard drive are similar to tracks on music boards, which is where the data is written on. </p>

    <h2> BUS</h2>
    <img src="computer bus.png" alt="Computer Bus" style="width:300px;height:200px">
    <p id="Hardware"> BUS transfers data through the parts of the computer. It reduces pathways required for communication with parts of a computer. The address bus transfers memory addresses that the processor uses to read and write data. The data bus transfers the instructions from the processor. The command bus transfers orders from the control unit being transferred to all other parts of the computer. The internal bus lets the processor communicate with the RAM. The external bus lets the parts of the motherboard communicate with each other and add new devices with expansion slots.</p>

    <h2> Keyboard, mouse, and monitor</h2>
    <img src="keyboard mouse and monitor.jpg" alt="Keyboard Mouse and Monitor" style="width:300px;height:200px">
    <p id="Hardware"> The keyboard has symbols on it that let you type what you want. The mouse is what is used to move the arrow around to click on things. The monitor is the screen that the computer has that lets you see things on the computer. </p>
