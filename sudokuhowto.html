        <b>// Store the new game button in a variable </b> </p>
        <p>  var newGameButton = document.getElementById("startnewgame");</p>
    This variable is the variable I used to make the new game button that when pushed, it will generate numbers on certain cells in the sudoku game.
    This is what will start the game, which the function is given to it by
    the get element by id with the function, "startnewgame".
    <p> <b>// Store all the sudoku cells in an array variable </b> </p>
    <p> var cells = document.getElementsByClassName("cell");</p>
    <p> This is an array that makes the small sections, rows, and columns of the sudoku.
    They are in boxes and small sections are a tiny bit apart from each other.
    They also have dropdown menus containing the numbers you put into the cell for 
    every cell. They all have the class name "cell".</p>
    <p> <b>// React to the button that starts a new game when clicked</b>
newGameButton.addEventListener("click", function() {</p>
    <p> This add event listener will give the new game button the function of 
    showing the numbers when clicked. It has the function from the add
    event listener which gives it the specific function to make certain cells 
    have certain numbers in them.</p>

    <img src="Screenshot 2017-05-11 at 1.25.19 PM.png" alt="After clicking new game button" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
   <p> As you can see, in the first image, there are no numbers, but when
   I clicked the New Game button, the numbers already placed are shown and 
   you can start trying to solve the puzzle.</p>
   <p><b> // Sets all number boxes to empty </b></p>
   <p> for (var i in cells) {</p>
        <p>cells[i].value = 0;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p> <b>&lt;!-- The sudoku puzzle has 9 by 9 cells. Also, it has 9 sections,<br/>        of 3 by 3 cells. <br/>        <br/>        To represent the sudoku board we first create a table of 3 by 3<br/>        for the sections, and for each section we have a subtable of 3 by 3<br/>        to hold the sudoku cells.<br/>        <br/>        Each sudoku cell is a select tag with options from 0 to 9 with 0 meaning<br/>        unselected.--&gt;</p>
    <p> This will make all the boxes initially not have a number before
    the new game button is clicked. Their value is 0, which means no number in
    the cell, the for is the variable that applies to all cells. As
    shown in the images below, I have not clicked the new game button
    and there are no numbers in any cell, only after I click the 
    New Game button.</p>

  <p> <b>// Initialize the new game numbers</b></p>
   <p>cells[0].value = 7;
   <p>cells[2].value = 4;
   <p>cells[3].value = 1;
   <p>cells[9].value = 5;
   <p>cells[10].value = 9;
   <p>cells[11].value = 8;
   <p>cells[14].value = 2;
   <p>cells[24].value = 1;
   <p>cells[25].value = 8;
   <p>cells[26].value = 6;
   <p>cells[28].value = 2;
   <p>cells[30].value = 8;
   <p>cells[32].value = 1;
   <p>cells[35].value = 5;
   <p>cells[37].value = 7;
   <p>cells[39].value = 3;
   <p>cells[41].value = 4;
   <p>cells[65].value = 1;</p>
});</p>  
  <p> These are the values of the cells. The number in the brackets have
  the cell number after that have the number before the semicolon. When
  the new game button is clicked, these numbers will be shown in their repsective 
  cell number. As shown in the image below, this is the numbers already in 
  cells, and as mentioned earlier, the numbers are in the cell after the 
  one shown in brackets in the code above (for example, the last number is a 
  number one which the code makes it in cell 66 when the code to put it 
  in that cell has a 65 in the brackets.</p>

    <p> <b>// Add a listener to each sudoku cell to detect collisions with rows</b></p>
<p><b>// columns, or sections which might have the same selected number</b></p>
for (var i in cells) {
    <p>cells[i].addEventListener("change", function() {</p>
    <p> This variable and add event listener make it so that it detects
    if a row, column, or small section has two or more of the same number 
    and it turns all of their cells red until a different number is placed 
    that is different from one of the red numbers into all the red cells.
    As shown in the image below, the ones' cells are red because two of 
    them are in the same small section, one of them is in the same row as 
    another one, and it is also in the same column as another one.</p>
    <img src="Screenshot 2017-05-11 at 1.34.11 PM.png" alt="A collision has happened" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
    <p><b>// Get selected value for this cell. The "this" variable holds</b>
     <p>  <b> // the object</b>
      <p>  <b>// the id of the object is a 3 digit number of the format:</b>
       <p><b> // section/row/column. We get the id to determine these values</b>
        <p>var selectedvalue = this.value;
        <p>var selectedid = this.id;
        <p>var selectedsection = selectedid[0];
        <p>var selectedcolumn = selectedid[2];
        <p>var selectedrow = selectedid[1];
    <p> These variables have the ids of the cells and their values (Like
    the first cell's id is "111" and the top left hand corner of the second
    small section is "214", etc.). The section is the first digit, the 
    row is the second digit and the last is the column.</p>
    <p>
       <p><b> // Go over all other cells and if we have the same row, column,</b></p>
       <p><b> // or section and we have the same selected value, we have a collision,</b></p>
       <p><b> // the selected value is wrong</b></p>
        <p>for (var j in cells) {</p>
            <p>cells[j].style.backgroundColor = "";</p>
            <p>if (this.id != cells[j].id) {</p>
            <p> This code makes it so that collisions can happen with more
            than two cells, as shown in the image below. It also makes it so 
            that no other cells change color other than the ones that are 
            in the collision.</p>
                <img src="Screenshot 2017-05-11 at 1.34.11 PM.png" alt="A collision has happened" style="width:400px;height:300px;">

                <p>var cellvalue = cells[j].value;</p>
                <p>var cellid = cells[j].id;</p>
                <p>var cellsection = cellid[0];</p>
                <p>var cellcolumn = cellid[2];</p>
                <p>var cellrow = cellid[1];</p>
                <p>if (selectedrow == cellrow ||</p>
                    <p>selectedcolumn == cellcolumn ||</p>
                    <p>selectedsection == cellsection) {</p>
                    <p>if (selectedvalue == cellvalue) {</p>
                    <p> These variables will get the values and ids of
                    cells, sections, rows, and columns and compares them to a 
                    selected cells</p>
    <p> <b>// We have a collision, make both the selected cell and the</b></p>
                       <p> <b>// colliding cell red</b></p>
                        
                        <p>this.style.backgroundColor = "red";</p>
                        <p>cells[j].style.backgroundColor = "red";</p>
    <p> This code detects collisions and determines exactly what color 
    two or more cells will turn if there is a collision. The 
    style.backgroundcolor is red and the second line of this code
    has cells and the style.backgroundcolor to make the cells turn
    red during collisions. The style.background.color also determines what
    color the cells in a collision turn into in the collision. As shown in 
    the image below, the collision cells are specifically turned red and
    not blue or green or yellow.</p>
