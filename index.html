    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <h2> Where I've been</h2>
    <p id="AboutMe"> I am Rammy Baroudi and I am a sophomore at Summit Rainier. I live in San Jose, California. I am currently 15 years old and my birthday is September 13th. My favortite video game is Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. I like it because it is an awesome fighting game where characters from Nintendo games fight each other. My friend Arjun used to play it with me and we had a lot of fun. I have been a gamer since I was in elementary school, and I am still a gamer to this day. My favorite movie is Star Trek: Beyond. I liked it because I like Sci-Fi movies and it is the most recent movie I saw in the theatre.
